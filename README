I wrote this program using Python 3.4  This program should be used with an ELM327 interface that communicates at 38400 baud.
This program will pull codes out of most cars from 1996 to present.  The program needs tkinter and pyserial.  Most of the work
was in the translation of the codes from hexidecimal to a readable format.  The data is taken from the buffer and converted to 
decimal form and then it must be run through a formula to make the data useful.

The codes will then be displayed.  The code's meaning can be found using other sources.
The program can also be used to clear the codes.  The windows version uses an automatic port detection.
